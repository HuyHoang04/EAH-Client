Confirm correct framework version (Express, Fastify, Next, etc.).

Don’t forget await in async calls.

Always use try/catch for async.

Check API version differences in libraries.

Confirm correct framework config (e.g., middleware).

Write tests, especially for edge cases.

Run and log code before using in production.

Benchmark performance for heavy logic.

Follow project naming & style rules.

Review env/config (DB_URL, API_KEY).
